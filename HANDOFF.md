# DISCORD SNIPER — THE HANDOFF
Read this first. It is the living memory of the project: what the machine is,
every rule it trades by, and how G works. Update it whenever a rule changes.
Last updated: 2026-08-27 evening (after the dead-paper / verify-before-trust fixes).
No secrets live here — keys and account ids stay in settings.json (gitignored).

## Who and what
- G (giancuffaro230@gmail.com) — non-coder, trades options + futures live.
  Direct, wants things CONDENSED. "Fix everything is default always" — bugs
  get fixed without asking. Real-money actions (placing/canceling orders,
  unlocking accounts, funding, questionnaires) are HIS alone, always.
- The machine: Chrome MV3 extension (reads Discord + Whop rooms in Profile 2,
  v3.3.2) + Python bridge (bridge.py on 127.0.0.1:8787) firing real orders at
  Webull (options), Webull futures, NinjaTrader (OIF files), Topstep/ProjectX.
- SEPARATE tool: "Market Sniper" (his own build, 127.0.0.1:8000) trades HIS
  manual scalps on the SAME Webull account. Coexistence rule: positions the
  bot didn't originate are HIS — visible, never stop-managed, never sold,
  never blocking a room call in the same symbol.

## Rules of the house (current, in force)
- ENTRIES: bid the caller's price or better; pullback entries cross the ask
  at the touch. RN pullback is global and ON by default (waits for the next
  round number, 10-min window). All rooms LIVE by default; toggling off is
  G's only bench. One contract per entry while the bracket strategy is on.
- STRIKES: never more than 1 strike OTM. Deeper OTM snaps to the first OTM
  rung (quote-verified; falls back to ATM/ITM walk). ADD buys the held strike.
- FUTURES: micros only, always (NQ->MNQ, ES->MES, ...). Entry snaps to the
  25-pt grid in his favour. Their stop/target wins; 25/50 fills the gaps.
- SPREAD GUARD (entries only): refuse if spread > 20% of mid, or > max($0.20,
  10% of mid).
- THE RATCHET v2 (strategy 10/10): -10% stop born WITH the order (combo
  bracket; rebased to the FILL if filled better). At +10% stop jumps to
  BREAKEVEN; every further +10% locks another +10%, no ceiling. Contracts
  under $1.00 arm at +15% instead (0DTE noise). The stop does the selling.
- SWINGS: expiry 14+ days out IS a swing (auto-tagged). Their stock-level
  stop runs it (underlying watcher); no level = wide -25%. Never the scalp stop.
- DEDUPE LADDER: extension in-flight contract lock -> bridge echo-lock (same
  contract OPEN within 20s refused, any path) -> per-trader "already in"
  book claim -> better-average exception: same trader, same contract, filled,
  new price >=1% under what was PAID -> one ADD (average-down), never more.
- RETRACTION: "not ready / revising / scratch that / cancel that / disregard
  / hold off / nevermind" pulls that trader's resting bids AND kills their
  armed pullback hunts. Exits/held positions untouched.
- STALE-ENTRY GATE: entries older than 3 minutes (re-scan, slow tab) never
  fire. Exits pass at any age. Negations ("NOT GETTING IN", "too expensive")
  hard-veto everything; "out the gate(s)" is hype, never an exit.
- EXITS: urgent sells cross the bid; fill-confirmed (phantom-exit family).
  Bare exits ("OUT NVDA") resolve to the held contract via the book. Pulled
  bids are confirmed dead — if the cancel lost the race, the exit sells the
  fill immediately.
- RESTARTS: state photo on every event. On boot: expired options = dead
  paper, dropped, zero credit; everything else is UNVERIFIED until the
  broker confirms it (then watchdog+stop arm); gone = closed at "a price I
  never saw", never a stale quote. Mid-market code updates self-apply at the
  first safe window (no bids/hunts in flight); RESTART BRIDGE.bat pre-flights
  and warns. Resting stops at Webull guard every gap.
- VOICE: ears transcribe always; FIRING is a popup switch, default OFF
  (85%+ confidence when on; typed copy skipped as echo for 5 min).
- WHOP: watchdog reloads stale tabs (market hours) and black-shell pages
  (any hour, via the 1-min health pulse). Silence alarm: any room quiet 40
  min during market hours -> desktop notification.
- THE POCKET (hidden from UI on purpose): scalp-entry clock gate :43-:51
  exists behind settings flag pocket_scalps_only (default off). Journals
  stamp each trade's minute-of-hour; decision comes from HIS fill data,
  not the QQQ study (2yr: :45-:51 has +27% dollar-follow-through).

## Operational truths
- settings.json: ALL keys, gitignored, never pushed. Never run git write ops
  from the sandbox (locks can't be unlinked); AUTO PUSH.bat is a resident
  45s push-on-change loop; START HERE.bat saves+pushes before its reset.
- Journals: journal-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx built from broker fills (connector)
  FIFO-matched vs trades.log; includes entry minute-of-hour. Scoreboard:
  Felony = Trademorewiser (one identity). Whop = Felony only.
- sniper-autopilot scheduled task: */30 ET — preflight ~9:30, sync watch
  market hours, close-out ~16:30. Never places/cancels orders, never touches
  settings.json.
- Multi-account: extras (e.g. "L") mirror LIVE entries 1:1 with own books/
  stops, gated by subscription (paid_month). Exits always mirror.

## Standing chores (G's side, updated 8/27 evening)
1. Webull OPTIONS QUESTIONNAIRE — API sells were refused 8/26 ("update your
   options trading application"). Until done, bot can buy but may not sell.
   THE most important chore. G walked through steps 8/27.
2. Webull futures account: $0 BY CHOICE (his call 8/27) — NT + Topstep carry
   futures; Webull-futures refusals are clean and intentional.
3. NinjaTrader ATM template: decided 8/27 — name SNIPER, stop 100 ticks /
   target 200 ticks (= 25/50 pts on MNQ), qty 1. G creates it in NT8 and
   types SNIPER into the popup's NinjaTrader field.
4. Topstep XFA: locked/paused — unlock in TopstepX Risk Settings (-$680
   pre-existing on it).

## Watch items
- Deepgram key may be one char short (39) — watch for voice auth errors.
- Bridge log rotation: SDK logs purge at boot, 2-day keep.
- Chrome: hardware acceleration OFF recommended (GPU black-tab disease).
- His L account: verify no orphan positions after mirror exits.

## How to update this file
At the end of any session that changed a rule, add/edit the rule above,
bump the "Last updated" line, and let AUTO PUSH sweep it. The bridge's own
daily handoffs/HANDOFF-<date>.md is a thin status snapshot only — this file
is the memory.
